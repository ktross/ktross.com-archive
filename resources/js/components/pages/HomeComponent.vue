                    <p>There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Michael! We just call it a sausage. Michael! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Steve Holt! He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
                    <p>Really? Did nothing cancel? <strong> I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.</strong> <em> No, I did not kill Kitty.</em> However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
                    <p>There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Michael! Really? Did nothing cancel? Really? Did nothing cancel? He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I'm afraid I just blue myself. Steve Holt! Michael! Guy's a pro. Really? Did nothing cancel? I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I'm a monster.</p>
                    <p>No… but I'd like to be asked! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. No… but I'd like to be asked!</p>
                    <p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Michael! As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.</p>
                    <p>Guy's a pro. Really? Did nothing cancel? I'm a monster. I'm a monster. Across from where?</p>
                    <p>Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Really? Did nothing cancel?</p>
                    <p>Really? Did nothing cancel? Not tricks, Michael, illusions. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Army had half a day. What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?"</p>
